    "- **Example**:  \n",

    "- **Definition**:  \n",
    "  Polymorphism, derived from \"poly\" (many) and \"morphism\" (forms), refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a shared interface. In Python, polymorphism allows different classes to share the same method name while allowing these methods to behave differently depending on which object calls them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**:  \n",
    "  Polymorphism enables the ability to redefine methods in derived classes, allowing objects to take on different forms in different scenarios. This flexibility makes it easier to write code that can work with objects of different types, as long as they implement the expected interface."

    "#### 1. Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**:  \n",
    "  Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class. It restricts access to some of the object's components and can prevent accidental modification of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example in Code**:  \n",
    "  - **Classes and Methods**: The `Pets` and `Cat` classes encapsulate their attributes (`animals`, `name`, `age`) and methods (`__init__`, `walk`, `sing`) within themselves.\n",
    "  - **Access Control**: Although Python does not enforce access control strictly, using class-based design naturally encapsulates functionality and data within objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Cat():\n",
    "      is_lazy = True\n",
    "\n",
    "      def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "          self.name = name\n",
    "          self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "      def walk(self):\n",
    "          return f'{self.name} is just walking around'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Encapsulated Data and Behavior**: The `Cat` class encapsulates attributes like `name`, `age`, and behavior such as walking (`walk` method). The `Pets` class encapsulates a list of animals and the behavior of making them walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**:  \n",
    "  Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts of an object to interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example in Code**:  \n",
    "  - **Simplified Interaction**: The `walk` method in the `Pets` class abstracts the details of how each `Cat` walks. The user of the `Pets` class only needs to call `my_pets.walk()` to make all cats walk, without knowing the specifics of each `Cat` instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Pets():\n",
    "      def __init__(self, animals):\n",
    "          self.animals = animals\n",
    "\n",
    "      def walk(self):\n",
    "          for animal in self.animals:\n",
    "              print(animal.walk())\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Abstraction of Behavior**: The `Pets` class provides a high-level method `walk` that hides the details of iterating over each `Cat` and calling their respective `walk` method. This abstraction makes it easier to manage the group of pets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**:  \n",
    "  Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (base class). This enables code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example in Code**:  \n",
    "  - **Subclassing `Cat`**: The classes `Simon`, `Sally`, and `Tom` inherit from the `Cat` class, gaining access to its attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Simon(Cat):\n",
    "      def sing(self, sounds):\n",
    "          return f'{sounds}'\n",
    "\n",
    "  class Sally(Cat):\n",
    "      def sing(self, sounds):\n",
    "          return f'{sounds}'\n",
    "\n",
    "  class Tom(Cat):\n",
    "      def sing(self, sounds):\n",
    "          return f'{sounds}'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Inherited Behavior**: Each subclass (`Simon`, `Sally`, `Tom`) inherits the `walk` method from `Cat` and can override or extend it if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**:  \n",
    "  Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a shared interface, often by overriding methods in derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example in Code**:  \n",
    "  - **Method Overriding**: While the `walk` method is implemented in the `Cat` class, polymorphism is exhibited when this method is called on instances of `Simon`, `Sally`, and `Tom`, each of which may implement or inherit the method differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Polymorphic Behavior**: The `walk` method is the same across `Simon`, `Sally`, and `Tom`, but if needed, each subclass could have a unique implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_pets.walk()\n",
    "  # Outputs:\n",
    "  # Simon is just walking around\n",
    "  # Sally is just walking around\n",
    "  # Tom is just walking around\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Shared Interface**: The loop in the `walk` method of the `Pets` class demonstrates polymorphism by treating all elements in `self.animals` as objects with a `walk` method, regardless of their specific subclass."
